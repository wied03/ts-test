     *
     * #### Context variables ####
     *
     * The following context variables are available to Jira expressions evaluated by this resource. Their presence depends on various factors; usually you need to manually request them in the context object sent in the payload, but some of them are added automatically under certain conditions.
     *
     *  *  `user` ([User](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#user)): The current user. Always available and equal to `null` if the request is anonymous.
     *  *  `app` ([App](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#app)): The [Connect app](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/index/#connect-apps) that made the request. Available only for authenticated requests made by Connect Apps (read more here: [Authentication for Connect apps](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/security-for-connect-apps/)).
     *  *  `issue` ([Issue](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#issue)): The current issue. Available only when the issue is provided in the request context object.
     *  *  `issues` ([List](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#list) of [Issues](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#issue)): A collection of issues matching a JQL query. Available only when JQL is provided in the request context object.
     *  *  `project` ([Project](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#project)): The current project. Available only when the project is provided in the request context object.
     *  *  `sprint` ([Sprint](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#sprint)): The current sprint. Available only when the sprint is provided in the request context object.
     *  *  `board` ([Board](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#board)): The current board. Available only when the board is provided in the request context object.
     *  *  `serviceDesk` ([ServiceDesk](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#servicedesk)): The current service desk. Available only when the service desk is provided in the request context object.
     *  *  `customerRequest` ([CustomerRequest](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#customerrequest)): The current customer request. Available only when the customer request is provided in the request context object.
     *
     * Also, custom context variables can be passed in the request with their types. Those variables can be accessed by key in the Jira expression. These variable types are available for use in a custom context:
     *
     *  *  `user`: A [user](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#user) specified as an Atlassian account ID.
     *  *  `issue`: An [issue](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#issue) specified by ID or key. All the fields of the issue object are available in the Jira expression.
     *  *  `json`: A JSON object containing custom content.
     *  *  `list`: A JSON list of `user`, `issue`, or `json` variable types.
     *
     * This operation can be accessed anonymously.
     *
     * **[Permissions](#permissions) required**: None. However, an expression may return different results for different users depending on their permissions. For example, different users may see different comments on the same issue.
     * Permission to access Jira Software is required to access Jira Software context variables (`board` and `sprint`) or fields (for example, `issue.sprint`).

     *  *  `notifications` Identifies the [recipients](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/8YdKLg#Creatinganotificationscheme-recipientsRecipients) of notifications for each event. Recipients can be any of the following types:
     *

     * ### About permission schemes and grants ###
     *
     * A permission scheme is a collection of permission grants. A permission grant consists of a `holder` and a `permission`.
     *
     * #### Holder object ####
     *
     * The `holder` object contains information about the user or group being granted the permission. For example, the *Administer projects* permission is granted to a group named *Teams in space administrators*. In this case, the type is `"type": "group"`, and the parameter is the group name, `"parameter": "Teams in space administrators"`. The `holder` object is defined by the following properties:
     *
     *  *  `type` Identifies the user or group (see the list of types below).
     *  *  `parameter` The value of this property depends on the `type`. For example, if the `type` is a group, then you need to specify the group name.
     *
     * The following `types` are available. The expected values for the `parameter` are given in parenthesis (some `types` may not have a `parameter`):
     *
     *  *  `anyone` Grant for anonymous users.
     *  *  `applicationRole` Grant for users with access to the specified application (application name). See [Update product access settings](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/3YxjL) for more information.
     *  *  `assignee` Grant for the user currently assigned to an issue.
     *  *  `group` Grant for the specified group (group name).
     *  *  `groupCustomField` Grant for a user in the group selected in the specified custom field (custom field ID).
     *  *  `projectLead` Grant for a project lead.
     *  *  `projectRole` Grant for the specified project role (project role ID).
     *  *  `reporter` Grant for the user who reported the issue.
     *  *  `sd.customer.portal.only` Jira Service Desk only. Grants customers permission to access the customer portal but not Jira. See [Customizing Jira Service Desk permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/24dKLg) for more information.
     *  *  `user` Grant for the specified user (user ID - historically this was the userkey but that is deprecated and the account ID should be used).
     *  *  `userCustomField` Grant for a user selected in the specified custom field (custom field ID).
     *
     * #### Built-in permissions ####
     *
     * The [built-in Jira permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg) are listed below. Apps can also define custom permissions. See the [project permission](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/modules/project-permission/) and [global permission](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/modules/global-permission/) module documentation for more information.

     *
     * [Project roles](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/3odKLg) are a flexible way to to associate users and groups with projects. In Jira Cloud, the list of project roles is shared globally with all projects, but each project can have a different set of actors associated with it (unlike groups, which have the same membership throughout all Jira applications).
     *
     * Project roles are used in [permission schemes](#api-rest-api-3-permissionscheme-get), [email notification schemes](#api-rest-api-3-notificationscheme-get), [issue security levels](#api-rest-api-3-issuesecurityschemes-get), [comment visibility](#api-rest-api-3-comment-list-post), and workflow conditions.
     *
     * #### Members and actors ####
     *
     * In the Jira REST API, a member of a project role is called an *actor*. An *actor* is a group or user associated with a project role.
     *
     * Actors may be set as [default members](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/3odKLg#Managingprojectroles-Specifying'defaultmembers'foraprojectrole) of the project role or set at the project level:
     *
     *  *  Default actors: Users and groups that are assigned to the project role for all newly created projects. The default actors can be removed at the project level later if desired.
     *  *  Actors: Users and groups that are associated with a project role for a project, which may differ from the default actors. This enables you to assign a user to different roles in different projects.

   * Evaluates a Jira expression and returns its value.
   *
   * This resource can be used to test Jira expressions that you plan to use elsewhere, or to fetch data in a flexible way. Consult the [Jira expressions documentation](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions/) for more details.
   *
   * #### Context variables ####
   *
   * The following context variables are available to Jira expressions evaluated by this resource. Their presence depends on various factors; usually you need to manually request them in the context object sent in the payload, but some of them are added automatically under certain conditions.
   *
   *  *  `user` ([User](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#user)): The current user. Always available and equal to `null` if the request is anonymous.
   *  *  `app` ([App](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#app)): The [Connect app](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/index/#connect-apps) that made the request. Available only for authenticated requests made by Connect Apps (read more here: [Authentication for Connect apps](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/security-for-connect-apps/)).
   *  *  `issue` ([Issue](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#issue)): The current issue. Available only when the issue is provided in the request context object.
   *  *  `issues` ([List](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#list) of [Issues](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#issue)): A collection of issues matching a JQL query. Available only when JQL is provided in the request context object.
   *  *  `project` ([Project](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#project)): The current project. Available only when the project is provided in the request context object.
   *  *  `sprint` ([Sprint](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#sprint)): The current sprint. Available only when the sprint is provided in the request context object.
   *  *  `board` ([Board](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#board)): The current board. Available only when the board is provided in the request context object.
   *  *  `serviceDesk` ([ServiceDesk](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#servicedesk)): The current service desk. Available only when the service desk is provided in the request context object.
   *  *  `customerRequest` ([CustomerRequest](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#customerrequest)): The current customer request. Available only when the customer request is provided in the request context object.
   *
   * Also, custom context variables can be passed in the request with their types. Those variables can be accessed by key in the Jira expression. These variable types are available for use in a custom context:
   *
   *  *  `user`: A [user](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#user) specified as an Atlassian account ID.
   *  *  `issue`: An [issue](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#issue) specified by ID or key. All the fields of the issue object are available in the Jira expression.
   *  *  `json`: A JSON object containing custom content.
   *  *  `list`: A JSON list of `user`, `issue`, or `json` variable types.
   *
   * This operation can be accessed anonymously.
   *
   * **[Permissions](#permissions) required**: None. However, an expression may return different results for different users depending on their permissions. For example, different users may see different comments on the same issue.
   * Permission to access Jira Software is required to access Jira Software context variables (`board` and `sprint`) or fields (for example, `issue.sprint`).

   * ### About notification schemes ###
   *
   * A notification scheme is a list of events and recipients who will receive notifications for those events. The list is contained within the `notificationSchemeEvents` object and contains pairs of `events` and `notifications`:
   *
   *  *  `event` Identifies the type of event. The events can be [Jira system events](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/8YdKLg#Creatinganotificationscheme-eventsEvents) or [custom events](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/AIlKLg).
   *  *  `notifications` Identifies the [recipients](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/8YdKLg#Creatinganotificationscheme-recipientsRecipients) of notifications for each event. Recipients can be any of the following types:
   *
   *      *  `CurrentAssignee`
   *      *  `Reporter`
   *      *  `CurrentUser`
   *      *  `ProjectLead`
   *      *  `ComponentLead`
   *      *  `User` (the `parameter` is the user key)
   *      *  `Group` (the `parameter` is the group name)
   *      *  `ProjectRole` (the `parameter` is the project role ID)
   *      *  `EmailAddress`
   *      *  `AllWatchers`
   *      *  `UserCustomField` (the `parameter` is the ID of the custom field)
   *      *  `GroupCustomField`(the `parameter` is the ID of the custom field)
   *
   * *Note that you should allow for events without recipients to appear in responses.*
   *
   * **[Permissions](#permissions) required:** Permission to access Jira, however the user must have permission to administer at least one project associated with a notification scheme for it to be returned.

  /**
   * Returns all permission schemes.
   *
   * ### About permission schemes and grants ###
   *
   * A permission scheme is a collection of permission grants. A permission grant consists of a `holder` and a `permission`.
   *
   * #### Holder object ####
   *
   * The `holder` object contains information about the user or group being granted the permission. For example, the *Administer projects* permission is granted to a group named *Teams in space administrators*. In this case, the type is `"type": "group"`, and the parameter is the group name, `"parameter": "Teams in space administrators"`. The `holder` object is defined by the following properties:
   *
   *  *  `type` Identifies the user or group (see the list of types below).
   *  *  `parameter` The value of this property depends on the `type`. For example, if the `type` is a group, then you need to specify the group name.
   *
   * The following `types` are available. The expected values for the `parameter` are given in parenthesis (some `types` may not have a `parameter`):
   *
   *  *  `anyone` Grant for anonymous users.
   *  *  `applicationRole` Grant for users with access to the specified application (application name). See [Update product access settings](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/3YxjL) for more information.
   *  *  `assignee` Grant for the user currently assigned to an issue.
   *  *  `group` Grant for the specified group (group name).
   *  *  `groupCustomField` Grant for a user in the group selected in the specified custom field (custom field ID).
   *  *  `projectLead` Grant for a project lead.
   *  *  `projectRole` Grant for the specified project role (project role ID).
   *  *  `reporter` Grant for the user who reported the issue.
   *  *  `sd.customer.portal.only` Jira Service Desk only. Grants customers permission to access the customer portal but not Jira. See [Customizing Jira Service Desk permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/24dKLg) for more information.
   *  *  `user` Grant for the specified user (user ID - historically this was the userkey but that is deprecated and the account ID should be used).
   *  *  `userCustomField` Grant for a user selected in the specified custom field (custom field ID).
   *
   * #### Built-in permissions ####
   *
   * The [built-in Jira permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg) are listed below. Apps can also define custom permissions. See the [project permission](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/modules/project-permission/) and [global permission](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/modules/global-permission/) module documentation for more information.

   * ### About project roles ###
   *
   * [Project roles](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/3odKLg) are a flexible way to to associate users and groups with projects. In Jira Cloud, the list of project roles is shared globally with all projects, but each project can have a different set of actors associated with it (unlike groups, which have the same membership throughout all Jira applications).
   *
   * Project roles are used in [permission schemes](#api-rest-api-3-permissionscheme-get), [email notification schemes](#api-rest-api-3-notificationscheme-get), [issue security levels](#api-rest-api-3-issuesecurityschemes-get), [comment visibility](#api-rest-api-3-comment-list-post), and workflow conditions.
   *
   * #### Members and actors ####
   *
   * In the Jira REST API, a member of a project role is called an *actor*. An *actor* is a group or user associated with a project role.
   *
   * Actors may be set as [default members](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/3odKLg#Managingprojectroles-Specifying'defaultmembers'foraprojectrole) of the project role or set at the project level:
   *
   *  *  Default actors: Users and groups that are assigned to the project role for all newly created projects. The default actors can be removed at the project level later if desired.
   *  *  Actors: Users and groups that are associated with a project role for a project, which may differ from the default actors. This enables you to assign a user to different roles in different projects.
   *
   * **[Permissions](#permissions) required:** *Administer Jira* [global permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/x4dKLg).

   *     {
   *        "type": "RemoteOnlyCondition"
   *      }
   *
   * ##### Only assignee condition #####
